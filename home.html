                            We believe in giving people the power to fight global warming
                            on there doorsteps. As we believe that in order to combat climate change,
                            it's going to take the actions of individuals and not of nations. 
                            Hydroelectricity is the most efficient way to convert available energy to electricity. 
                            However the most common sources of power in the household is fossil fuels. 
                            This made no sense to me, seen as we are heading in the direction where by the year 2052 we going to run out of fossil fuels. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The reason hydroelectricity is not used as much as other sources as there are only so many rivers in Ireland and most of them already have hydroelectric power stations.
                            What if there was another way to harvest hydropower, well thats what I hope to achieve with my device, the hydro-newton. It is a turbine that you attach to the end of 
                            the downpipe of your gutter. It uses the rainwater falling down the downpipe of the gutter to turn the turnine and generate electricity  
                            The three aims of this device is to be efficient in the Irish climate, be a cheap source of renewable energy and to be simple to install and use, 
                            to assist in lowering the costs of installation and maintenance.

                    <p>
                        Ireland has set the ambitious goal of reaching 70% of all energy produced to be renewable by 2030 
                        . However, in 2010, 15% of the energy was renewable , in four years this only increased by 6%. 
                        This means that if we keep going at the same rate of improvement then we’ll only be at 45%, that’s 25% off our goal! 
                        This means we need to drastically increase the amount of renewable energy. One way of doing this is to increase 
                        Hydroelectricity production. The main issue with this is that there are many disadvantages of Hydroelectric dams, 
                        such as how 
                        it's expensive and the Environmental Consequences e.g. the flooding of land in the building of the reservoir.
                        These only apply to Hydroelectric dams which is currently the only method of harvesting hydroelectricity.
                        However, I propose a new way, a better way. A way that has zero environmental consequences and is low cost. 
                        This is to utilize all the rainwater flowing out of all our gutters. If these devices are implemented in 
                        households across the country we can help drastically improve the rate at which we reach our goal of 70% by 2030.  
                        As Hydroelectric power is the most efficient way to turn available energy to electricity, which an efficiency rate of 90%,
                         however the majority of the renewable energy produced in Ireland is wind and that has an energy conversion rate of 50% at best.

                        <p>
                            The aim of the Hydro-Newton was always to be low cost in order to be available to everyone.

                            It is a source of renewable energy after all.

                        <h4>&#10148; Easy to install</h4>
                        <p>
                            All you need to do is install a few screws and wire up the device to the battery 
                            and away you go. You are generating electricity and don't need to maintain the system
                            , just sit back relax and enjoy that free electricity.
